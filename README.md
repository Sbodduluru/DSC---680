Applied Data Science

Predicting stock prices is a popular use case for machine learning and predictive analytics. SPDR Gold Shares (Exchange Traded Funds) offer investors an innovative, relatively cost efficient and secure way to access the gold market. I want to predict the ETF prices for it based on the available variables and historical data. I know the historical prices are no clear indicators of whether a price will go up or down in future. With that risk, to solve these types of problems, the time series analysis will be the best tool for forecasting the trend or even future. I am using Auto ARIMA, Facebookâ€™s Prophet and some other machine learning algorithms to predict the stock price. We also know that, apart from the historical price changes of a stock - a lot of other factors influence the stock prices. Like, the current overall market conditions (Bull market/Bear market), the conditions of the industry (e.g. oil industry), leadership changes within the company or any new acquisitions etc., So, in order to do predict the stock price, we also have to analyze the sentiment of the market by scraping the published articles, news and social media data. However, I will just stick to technical and fundamental analysis of the stocks to predict its price in this project.
